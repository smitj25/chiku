Page 10

3.1 Screening Requirements
3.1.1 All customers must be screened against the OFAC SDN List at:
- Account opening
- Periodic review (quarterly)
- When the SDN List is updated
- When customer information changes

3.1.2 Screening must include:
- Exact name matching
- Fuzzy name matching (to capture variations)
- Date of birth verification
- Address verification where available

3.1.3 Match Handling
When a potential match is identified:
- The transaction must be immediately held
- The Compliance Officer must be notified within 4 hours
- A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) may be required

3.1.4 Voluntary Self-Disclosure (VSD)
If the organization discovers that it has processed transactions involving a sanctioned party, 
it must file a Voluntary Self-Disclosure with OFAC. Filing a VSD generally results in significantly 
reduced penalties.

- Document the basis for clearing false positives
- Maintain records of all cleared alerts for 5 years
- Review false positive rates quarterly

All confirmed or suspected sanctions matches must be escalated as follows:
1. Compliance Analyst → Compliance Manager (within 2 hours)
2. Compliance Manager → Chief Compliance Officer (within 4 hours)
3. Chief Compliance Officer → Board Risk Committee (within 24 hours if material)
4. File blocking report with OFAC within 10 business days
